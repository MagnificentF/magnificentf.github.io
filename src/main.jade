        h1 Just exactly who is
        h1 The Magnificent Miss F ?
        p Some say she is just a myth... <br>others believe that she was once a person just as you or I, <br>but is now made almost entirely of bits of antique taxidermy and clockwork. <br>Others argue that she is some sort of changeling trapped in the wrong dimension, <br>or perhaps a top secret experiment by our own government, gone terribly wrong. <br>It is likely we may never know for sure.
        p One thing that is certain, is that when the moon is full and the wind blows just so, <br>and the crickets in the reeds chirp just at the very same time <br>that someone on a third level flat drops and breaks an old typewriter quite by accident...
        p Those are the times that the packages appear.
        p They come wrapped in old crinkled ads for hand knitted wool stockings, <br>tied with bits of ribbon and string found lining birds nests, <br>and long silken hairs from the heads of children stolen by gypsies. <br>One was hollow and covered completely in ornate keyholes, yet could not be seen through, <br>and still another floated just a bit off the ground and emitted a strange light, <br>yet when immersed in water (don't dare ask why or how this occurred), <br>it sank immediately like a broken heart.
        p As the whereabouts or even existence of The Magnificent Miss F. are in question, <br>I for one believe she is someplace here among us, <br>perhaps perched in an old clock tower keeping a chart of how many times a week <br>we make silly faces whilst tripping over inanimate objects, <br>and cross referencing it with a chart of how many times a day cats make silly faces whilst we trip over them. <br>Or tiptoeing across the surface of a pond stealing fireflies to make into ink for writing glowing reviews of boring plays. <br>Some say they catch fleeting glimpses of her in night gardens telling secrets to frogs, <br>or down the ends of paths that don't go any place...
        p As the packages keep coming, I for one must be inclined to believe that she is still out there someplace, <br>breathing life into very small and strange things. <br>I will continue to document their existence on these pages, <br>in hopes that someday they may have some scientific purpose...
        p I have found a set of plans intending to build some great machine, <br>in which her creations are to be used as cogs. <br>From my studies I have concluded this machines purpose appears to be <br>to turn the planet on its axis just a fraction of a degree, <br>so that half of the worlds scraped knees turn into something more amiable.
        p Perhaps bunnies.
        p Your humble Virtuoso,
        p Oni the Cat
